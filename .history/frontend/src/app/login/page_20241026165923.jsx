Project Description: Our team is going to make a password protected diary website. It will allow user to get started with its access by simply signing in with google or creating a new account. User will be able to create a new diary, can delete already created and can set lock and unlock the locked one. User must enter a correct password to access locked diaries. Apart from it, user will have a contact form to contact the company for any technical issues. Also, there will be a feature to view thought of the day and weather section after logging in.
